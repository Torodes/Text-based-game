# Text-based-game
A small text based game I made to learn C++ and object oriented programming.
This is my first program. I made this a year ago, after finishing my C++ course.

!Disclamer, I did not Spellcheck and my English was limited at the time of its creation!

I would be thankfull for your feedback
